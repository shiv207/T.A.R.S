{Anyways you are free to use any model u like personally i would suggest the gpt4all falcon model cause its pretty good from my tests overall, And primarily edit the code as you like add features and make ur own custom streamlit apps overall the apps code is modular so as far as adding new features is considered u should be able to do it pretty easily }
